# MedVault â€“ Personal Health Data Tracking System
MedVault is a personal health data management system where users can securely store their own health history, upload test results, track medication history, and plan health check-ups.

Developed using FastAPI and MongoDB, this application works with user authentication and JWT-based secure session management. Each user can only access their own health data.
